        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            This site is to help students with their site plans. It will change in
            the various areas to demo how to complete the assignment and examples of
            correct principles. The area includes on this web include Overview,
            Color Palette, Typography, Navigation, and Site Map.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bottom part of the assignment is a wireframe. Next week we will use
            the wireframe to build the home page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please use this page as an example of what to do. Students will be
            required to create a site map for their final project. If the students
            complete this project, it will be an excellent map for the final
            project.
        </p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
            Students of WDD 130 are the primary focus of this website. Each student
            brings different levels of expertise and background. For many, this is
            their time seeing HTML and CSS coding. The class also has some that are
            programmers and graphic artists.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beginning students will find this class challenging and sometimes
            frustrating. Hopefully, they will find this example helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Experienced students should find the newest HTML and CSS trends and
            hopefully help others. They may find this class boring. I hope not.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the rest of us, those who had some programming or graphic design, it
            will build on what

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
