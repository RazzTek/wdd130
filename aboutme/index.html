      My name is Garth Mikesell. I currently work at Utah State University as
      an IT Team Lead. My team members support the Merrill-Cazier Library.
      Working at the library has been the most extended five years of my life.
      I planned to work for USU for five years while attaining a master's
      degree in Instructional Technology and Design. That was 25 years ago.
      Somebody forgot to tell me, "You leave after you graduate."

      My church service has been bouncing between Young Men (mainly scouting)
      and Old Men (Elders). I found that you treat both groups the same way.
      My favorite calling was serving as an assistant scoutmaster to one of
      the best scoutmasters I know. I served in the Washington Spokane
      Mission, where I learned service projects work the best in helping the
      people.

      My Nick Name came from my dad. When I was born, the nurse asked what my
      name should be. My dad responded, "Charlie Brown." My brother still
      calls me Chuck.

      I love being a member Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
      becuase of the service opportunities. It makes me feel great when I
      server.
